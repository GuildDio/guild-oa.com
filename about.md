## Philosophy

## History

The story began in October 2016, when the idea of creating new,
special (means based on the ideas listed above) and innovative clan/team
first came to my mind. Taking into account that no large-scale or really
significant events have happened yet, simple and short events list seems
to be enough. Information on any important events will be pubslished in
the main section of the site in the form of posts.
