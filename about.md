## Philosophy

The following principles are considered to be axioms for us, and in case you
are thinking about the opportunity to join The Guild, please read them all
and decide for yourself.

 - We believe that OpenArena is very special (of course, in a good way) game,
   mostly because of its community. We appreciate both OpenArena and its
   community very much.
 - The point isn't just in Gameplay. OA is the way of communication.
 - All our members have reputation. We are old-timers in this game, we respect
   other players and we are respcted by others. If you want to be among us,
   take into account that things such us insulting, spamming, camping, any
   kinds of unfair play or disrespect for others aren't allowed.
 - Although, as already mentioned, Gameplay itself isn't the most important
   thing for us, we are the team of skillful players. *If you want to be among
   us, have some skill.*
 - We believe that there are many ways of improving/developing OA (or set
   of related technologies). We have [some ideas](https://github.com/OAGuild)
   and we are trying to work on it apart from other gaming activities.
 - We enjoy any types of *Clans action*, especially participation in *Clan Wars*.
   The Guild makes efforts to organize it. We hope that one fine day the former
   popularity of clans and clans rivalry will revive in OA.
 - We take pleasure in playing togerther. We like each other. ;)

## History

The story began in October 2016, when the idea of creating new,
special (means based on the ideas listed above) and innovative clan/team
first came to my mind. Taking into account that no large-scale or really
significant events have happened yet, simple and short events list seems
to be enough. Information on any important events will be published in
the main section of the site in the form of posts.
