title: Clan war with SoS
---

Great news, OA folks! Clans and clans rivalry still exist in OA. And the
proof is right here... :D
Yesterday (May 28, 2017) we had 4 awesome, *memorable* and **just good**
matches with our [SoS friends](http://clansos.sosforum.net/).
Two all weapons, and of course, two instantgib parties.

The first all weaps match was truly intensive, we were leading at the
beginning, but then SoS warmed up and started to recoup amazingly fast,
so only time limit stopped them. ;)

The next one was very balanced too, 5-4 overtime as you can see.

Then we continued with two instantgib games.
On speedy our opponents concentrated very seriously, and did the great job,
confirming the status of perfect railers. :)

The final match was spoiled a bit by some team changes during the game,
but we kept it fair, and had a *gg*, coming to draw in insta at the end. :p
