title: Hello, dear OpenArena community!

We don't think there is a real need to introduce ourselves, if you come to
this website, we are 80 percent sure you already saw us playing somewhere in
OA. Well, let's tell a bit about The Guild in general.

At first, we are [The Team](/about)...
We play different mods, but mostly CTF (both all weapons and instantgib).
Moreover, we are trying to develop the beautiful world of OA by making
[a set of technologies](https://github.com/OAGuild) somehow related to
the game, but this is the thing of the future.

One of events we are dreaming about and can't wait to happen is
*The Clan Wars*.
